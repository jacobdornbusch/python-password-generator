<h1>Password Generator (Proof of Concept)</h1>
This is a very simple Python program that generates secure passwords based on your preferences. It asks for the desired length of the password, complexity level, and whether you want to include special characters.

<h2>How to Use</h2>

1. Run the Python script.
<pre>python password_generator.py</pre>
2. The program will prompt you to provide the following information:
- Length of the password you want: Enter a number to determine the desired length of the password.
- Complexity level: Choose one of the following options:
  - "Low" complexity: Generates a password with only letters (lowercase and uppercase) and numbers.
  - "Medium" complexity: Adds special characters (like !, @, #, etc.) to the mix for a slightly more complex password.
  - "High" complexity: Creates a strong password by including an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, a digit, and, if you choose to include special characters, one of those too.
- Include special characters: Answer "yes" or "no" to determine whether special characters should be included in the password.
3. Based on your inputs, the program will generate a unique password that meets your criteria.
4. Copy and use the generated password wherever you need it.

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

- While this password generator aims to provide strong and random passwords, it's always a good idea to follow additional best practices for password security. Consider the following tips:
  - Use a password manager to securely store and manage your passwords.
  - Avoid using common patterns or easily guessable information in your passwords.
  - Regularly update your passwords, especially for sensitive accounts.
